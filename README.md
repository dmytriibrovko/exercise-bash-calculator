✔️ Write a calculator script calculator.sh which will work both with integer values and floating point values.

✔️ The calculator should take an arithmetic expression as an input parameter (for example $bash > calculator.sh 10.5/3)

✔️ The calculator must check the arithmetic expression and if the input of the calculator received symbols other than numbers, signs of arithmetic operations, the calculator must display an error and exit with code 128. Also remember to return the code 0 when the script completes successfully.

✔️ When implementing the calculator, you must use the functions

✔️ The functions must be grouped and placed in separate files and linked in the calculator.sh main script
